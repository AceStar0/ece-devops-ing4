# Before starting

To clone the repository :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AceStar0/ece-devops-ing4.git
```

# 1. Creation of a NodeJS web application

## Installation

This application is implemented in NodeJS along with a Redis database.

1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Install Redis](https://redis.io/download)

Go to the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the cloned repository and run:

```bash
npm install 
```

## Usage

- Run a web server

From the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the repository, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

![image](image/1.%20npm_run_start.png)

<http://localhost:3000> will be accessible and our web application will run (make sure to open the Redis server):

![image](image/1.%20localhost3000.png)

- Create a user

Send a POST request using the terminal:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"username":"sergkudinov", "firstname":"sergei", lastname":"kudinov"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/user
```

It will output:

```
{"status":"success","msg":"OK"}
```  

After, if you go to <http://localhost:3000/user/sergkudinov>, with "sergkudinov" being the username that you had in your POST data, it will display in the browser the following, with correspondance to the data that you posted:  

```bash
{"status":"success","msg":{"firstname":"sergei","lastname":"kudinov"}}
```

## Testing

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
npm run test
```  
  
All 12 tests should be passed :

# 2. Application of CI/CD pipeline uning Heroku and GitHub Actions

- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
- Continuous Delivery (Deployment) with Heroku
  
We created an YAML file [.github/workflow/main.yml](./.github/workflows/main.yml) and we add this code :

```yml
# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions

name: Main CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # CI part
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Define working-directory if you application is in a subfolder
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: user-api
     # Service containers to run with runner-job

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]
        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
        redis-version: [4, 5, 6]
        
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        
        
    - name: Start Redis
      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.4.0
      with:
        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}

    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
  # CD part
  deploy:
    needs: test # Requires CI part to be succesfully completed
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Read instructions how to configure this action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku#getting-started
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
          heroku_app_name: "ece-devops-ing4" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku_email: "ignace.bui@outlook.com"
          appdir: user-api # Define appdir if you application is in a subfolder
```

Once the CI/CD is integrated, we do have an automatic deployment in the Github Actions tab :
![image](image/2_github_actions.png)

As we have configured Heroku, we can check our Heroku app and we do have our web application running :

![image](image/2_heroku.png)

![image](image/2_herokuapp.png)


Redis service on Heroku is free, but it requires adding credit card information. Considering this limitation we will not run Redis on Heroku, and the application will be partially non-functional (it will print the "Hello world!" message on the home page, but the user API will not work). However, it will be enough to experience our CI/CD pipeline.


# 3. Application of the IaC approach

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a process of creating and managing systems using simple lines of code.
For this approch, we will be using :
* **Vagrant** : Vagrant is a machine provisioning tool used to create VMs and then populate them with applications.
* **Ansible** : Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning.

## Installation

Make sure you install these tools :

- [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)  
  
```bash
vagrant up
```

```bash
vagrant provision
```

# 4. Build Docker image of the application

Docker enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Installation

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  
  
## Usage

- We have created an build an image of our app and pushed it to Docker Hub :
![image](image/4_docker.png)

- In the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the repository's clone (where you can also find the [Dockerfile](/user-api/Dockerfile)), run the following command to pull our image :

```bash
docker pull acestar01/user-api
```

- Check if you have pulled the images to your local Docker images with the following command:

```bash
docker images
```

- Run the image:

```bash
docker run -p 12345:3000 -d acestar01/user-api
```
  
- Check if the container is running or not, with the collowing command :

```bash
docker ps
```  

- Now open your localhost: <http://localhost:12345/>, and if all went fine, you will have:  

(imaggeeeeeeee)

# 5. Organization of Container with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.

- Configure the [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) file to pull our user-api image :

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis

  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:3000"
    image: acestar01/user-api
```

# 6. Organization of Docker with Kubernetes

Kubernetes is open-source orchestration software that provides an API to control how and where those containers will run. It allows you to run your Docker containers and workloads and helps you to tackle some of the operating complexities when moving to scale multiple containers, deployed across multiple servers.

## Installation of Minikube

- [Install Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) following the instructions depending on your OS.

Start Minikube with:

```bash
minikube start
```

Verify that everything is OK with:

```bash
minikube status
```

## Deploy our app using Manifest YAML files

- Configure out the [`./k8s/deployment.yml`](./k8s/deployment.yml) file :

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-deployment
  labels:
    app: redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis
        ports:
          - containerPort: 6379
---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-api-deployment
  labels:
    app: user-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-api
        image: acestar01/user-api
        ports:
          - containerPort: 3000
        env:
          - name: REDIS_HOST
            value: redis-master
          - name: REDIS_PORT
            value: "6379"
```

- Once completed, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

- Configure out the [`./k8s/service.yml`](./k8s/service.yml) file :

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-service
  labels:
    app: redis
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 6379
      targetPort: 6379
  selector:
    app: redis

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: user-api-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: user-api
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
```

- Once you completed the file, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

- Check if the deployments are running with the following command :
  
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```  

![image](image/6_get_deployments.png)

- Check if the services are running with the following command :

```bash
kubectl get services
```

![image](image/6_get_services.png)

- Check if the pods are running with the following command :

```bash
kubectl get pods
```  

![image](image/6_get_pods.png)
  
- We can use the [dashboard](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/dashboard/) functionnality of Minikube to have a summary of the status through a dashboard with the following command that will open a new webpage :  

```bash
minikube dashboard
```
